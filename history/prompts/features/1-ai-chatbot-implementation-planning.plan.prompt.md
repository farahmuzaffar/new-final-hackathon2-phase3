# Prompt History Record: AI Chatbot Implementation Planning

## Original Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary

Executed the implementation planning workflow for the AI Chatbot feature following the Hackathon II Phase 3 requirements. Completed Phase 0 (research) and Phase 1 (design) of the planning process, producing the following artifacts:

1. Feature specification for the AI Chatbot (`specs/features/chatbot.md`)
2. AI agent behavior specification (`specs/features/chatbot-agent.md`)
3. MCP tools specification (`specs/api/mcp-tools.md`)
4. Implementation plan (`specs/main/plan.md`)
5. Research findings (`specs/main/research.md`)
6. Data models (`specs/main/data-model.md`)
7. API contracts (`specs/main/contracts/chat-api-contract.md`)
8. Quickstart guide (`specs/main/quickstart.md`)

The plan follows the existing architecture patterns from Phase 2 while extending functionality to include AI chatbot capabilities with MCP tools integration. All specifications adhere to the project's constitution principles, particularly focusing on spec-driven development and security requirements.
