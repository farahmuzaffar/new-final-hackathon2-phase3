# Hackathon Todo Phase2 Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Specifications are the single source of truth; All implementation must follow from documented specs; Changes to behavior require spec updates first

### II. No Manual Coding
All code must be generated by the AI agent from specs; If output is incorrect, specs must be refined instead of editing code directly

### III. Simplicity
Start simple, YAGNI principles; Focus on minimal viable implementation first

### IV. Code Quality
All code must pass linting and type checking; Clean, readable code required

### V. Documentation
All public functions and modules must be documented; README updated with all features

### VI. Versioning
MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD format; Semantic versioning strictly followed

### VII. Observability
Structured logging required; All errors must be properly handled and logged

## Phase-2 Scope

### IN SCOPE:
- Full-stack web app
- Next.js frontend
- FastAPI backend
- SQLModel + Neon PostgreSQL
- JWT-based authentication

### OUT OF SCOPE:
- AI chatbot
- MCP / Agents SDK
- Kubernetes, Docker, Helm
- Kafka, Dapr

## Additional Constraints
Technology stack: Python 3.13+; Dependencies must be justified; All external libraries reviewed for security

## Development Workflow
All changes require code review; Automated tests must pass before merging; Feature flags for experimental features

## Phase Completion Criteria
- Multi-user auth works
- Users see only their own tasks
- Data persists
- App runs locally
- Entire implementation is spec-driven

## Governance
All PRs/reviews must verify compliance; Complexity must be justified; Use project templates for consistency
